# Principle-of-Predictive-Analytics-in-Stock-Market-Prediction

Long term investment is one of the major investment strategies.It can be in the
form of mutual funds, stocks , real estate
or new sort of asset that is cryptocurrency
and many more.Identifying outperforming
mutual funds ex-ante is a notoriously difficult task. Whereas if we talk about stocks
, volatility in the share market is the major concern of many business person along
with the Indian middle class shareholder.
On other hand Cryptocurrency is a new
sort of asset that has emerged as a result
of the advancement of financial technology and it has created a big opportunity for
researches. Stock price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism.
Accounting all these factor this paper explains the use of analytics in the field of Financial investments to understand the dynamism , trends and volatility in order to
maximise the growth rate.


# Methodology
To meet the goals of this study, we used historical prices to train Reinforcement Learning, FIBONACCI, ML Models, and ANN+NLP Deep
Learning models for price prediction. Then, in
order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed
schemes, we compare the accuracy of our proposed model to that of existing models in five
stages:
• (1) collecting historical data;
• (2) data exploration and visualization;
• (3) training models;
• (4) testing the models;
• (5) extracting and comparing the results.
# Reinforcement Learning
will try to maximize
your profit which will be reward for him. The
Agent has functions defined for buy and sell
options. The rewards are subsequently calculated
by adding or subtracting the value generated by
executing the call option. The action taken at the
next state is influenced by the action taken on
the previous state. 1 refers to a Buy call while 2
refers to a Sell call. In every iteration, the state
is determined on the basis of which an action is
taken which will either buy or sell some stocks.

# FIBONACCI ratios
FIBONACCI ratios i.e. 61.8%, 38.2%, and
23.6% can help a trader in determining the
magnitude of a retracement. These levels can be
used by traders to position themselves for a trade.
It allows us to keep a close eye on the pricing and
investigate minute deviations.

# ML models 
there are various ml models such as
SVM ,LSTM which can help us to predict prices
for next few days , months or years.


# ANN+NLP+Deep learning,
With the help of
deep learning we will be considering the past
data along with foreign constraint ( rules by the
government, elections , covid) as input and then
analysing + predicting the price
Along with the prediction of prices , we will
find out how to handle volatility and will also try
to come up with an solution to handle chaotic data
for better understanding.
